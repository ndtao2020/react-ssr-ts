## The node.js example app

The node.js example app teaches the very basics of how to work with Contentful:

- consume content from the Contentful Delivery and Preview APIs
- model content
- edit content through the Contentful web app

The app demonstrates how decoupling content from its presentation enables greater flexibility and facilitates shipping higher quality software more quickly.

## Requirements

* Node >=12
* Git

Without any changes, this app is connected to a Contentful space with read-only access. To experience the full end-to-end Contentful experience, you need to connect the app to a Contentful space with read _and_ write access. This enables you to see how content editing in the Contentful web app works and how content changes propagate to this app.

## Common setup

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

### Comments

Comments may be added to your file as such:

```shell
# This is a comment
# Config
PORT=3000

# Session
COOKIE_SECRET=1#1@!545dfvxza@

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=secret
REDIS_URL=redis://default:1234@example.app:7339
```

## Steps for read-only access

To start the express server, run the following

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and take a look around.

## Use Docker
You can also run this app as a Docker container:

Step 1: Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/contentful/the-example-app.nodejs.git
```

Step 2: Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t the-example-app.nodejs .
```

Step 3: Run the Docker container locally:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d the-example-app.nodejs
```

If you created your own Contentful space, you can use it by overriding the following environment variables:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=<SPACE_ID> \
  -e CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_TOKEN=<DELIVERY_ACCESS_TOKEN> \
  -e CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_TOKEN=<PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN> \
  -d the-example-app.nodejs
```
